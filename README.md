# Diversity in Tech Roles vs Non Tech Roles

Diversity & Inclusion have been the talk of the town for a while now. Serious commitment towards diversity & inclusion started in 2013 when Tech companies started publishing their diversity numbers. But why just Tech companies, Even today more than 90% of Non-Tech companies do not release their diversity numbers. 
While starting out the project, I wanted to conduct a comparative analysis between Tech & Non-Tech companies. But due unavailability of data from Non-Tech companies I was unable to derive any meaningful insights with this comparison. 
Hence, I decided to move my focus & compare the diversity rates among Tech and Non-Tech roles within Tech companies. My analysis revealed that the diversity gap in Non-Tech roles is marginal vis-a-vis the diversity gap in Tech roles is substantial.
My motivation to pursue this topic was for personal gains. Being a woman, who has many a times felt marginalized or discriminated, I wanted to take this opportunity to research & understand the progress that has been made in the forays of diversity.
