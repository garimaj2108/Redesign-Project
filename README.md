# REDESIGN PROJECT - DIVERSITY GAP IN TECH COMPANIES: TECH ROLES VS NON-TECH ROLES

Diversity & Inclusion have been the talk of the town for a while now. Serious commitment towards diversity & inclusion started in 2013 when Tech companies started publishing their diversity numbers. But why just Tech companies, Even today more than 90% of Non-Tech companies do not release their diversity numbers. 
While starting out the project, I wanted to conduct a comparative analysis between Tech & Non-Tech companies. But due unavailability of data from Non-Tech companies I was unable to derive any meaningful insights with this comparison. 
Hence, I decided to move my focus & compare the diversity rates among Tech and Non-Tech roles within Tech companies. My analysis revealed that the diversity gap in Non-Tech roles is marginal vis-a-vis the diversity gap in Tech roles is substantial.
My motivation to pursue this topic was for personal gains. Being a woman, who has many a times felt marginalized or discriminated, I wanted to take this opportunity to research & understand the progress that has been made in the forays of diversity.

# INFOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS

# Claim - "DIVERSITY GAP IN SILICON VALLEY 2014" 
This claim is misleading because the data sources used to represent these numbers are either Global stats for Gender    diversity OR Countrywide stats for racial diversity. Hence its not about Diversity Gap in Silicon Valley, Its about Diversity Gap in Tech companies probably headquartered in Silicon Valley.
  
This infographic only gives data represention of 2014, hence there is no comparitive data available to understand the progress or no progress made in closing Diversity Gap in these companies.

The only thing that I can currently glean from this infographic is average percentages of Gender Gap and Racial Diversity but without comparitive analysis this can be misleading because having one look at the infographic I understand that the racial diversity or Gender Diversity is highly skewed in the United States but the infographic does not share overall U.S Population Gender or Racial distribution so to put in perspective the gender gap or racial diversity gap & to understand if there actually lies a problem or not.

# CHANGES PROPOSED TO BRING MORE VALUE TO THIS INFOGRAPHIC

- CLAIM: DIVERSITY GAP IN TECH COMPANIES: TECH ROLES VS NON-TECH ROLES
- To understand whether diversity gap exists only in tech jobs or are they equally prevalent in non-tech jobs, I am representing the diversity statistics for both tech and non tech roles in major Tech companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Tumblr, Ebay, Linkedin, Twitter, Pinterest.
My aim in doing so is to identify and quantify the gap in tech field vs non-tech field so that corrective measures can be taken to address the issue..
- I am also providing a comparitive analysis of Gender Diversity, Racial Diversity vis-a-vis overall U.S Gender distribution and U.S Racial distribution, to better understand gender or racial representation in workspace. 
- The information gleaned from these infographics can be used to understand why a certain race is represented more in Tech or why is there a gender gap in tech roles and what can be done to encourage under represented races/ gender to be a part of the Tech community.
